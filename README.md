# Isotomic

## What is Isotomic
Isotomic is a current wip open souce of my previouse version incog.glitch.me that is being rewritten from the ground up!

## Why Isotomic
Isotomic is the unblockable unblocker. This is because unlike most traditional unblockers, Isotomic masks internal urls behind a locally hosted file through the power of Iframes. This makes source urls increadibly hard to track and block by network admins. Also as a bonus, so long as you dont allow access to file urls in your extension settings, it can never be blocked! To further push the blocking capability, the Ultraviolet baackend url is encoded so that every single time you use it, it randomly generates a new unblocker url for you to access the Ultraviolet proxy, so if an admin blocks one url, Isotomic will generate you a new one instantly. This requires some serouse cloudflare shananagens thought.

## Cool, so how do I install it
Simply go to [isotomic.github.io](https://isotomic.github.io) and press download or another approved url, such as [isotomic.eclipsecraft.xyz](https://isotomic.eclipsecraft.xyz) and press download or just download index.html in this repository.

## I wanna host it myself >:(
this will be worked on in the future.
